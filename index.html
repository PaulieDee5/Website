		<h1>Who We Are</h1>
		<p class="Bio">The Canadian Beekeepers Council was formed in
			1940 to assist in negotiating fair practices forlabeling, grading, and marketing honey at the national level.

			The fledgling organization was underfunded and slow to communicate. It was difficult to respond to issues or develop the international markets that the members wanted. It was clear that there was a need for a higher profile and increased internationalrecognition. In 1970 The Canadian Beekeepers Council decided to change its name to Canadian Honey Council.
